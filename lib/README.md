# Implementation and Testing

### Implementation

- [x] **Converter from CFG to TA** 
     - Start from cleaner data structures (CFG, TA)
     - Learning O_bp

- [x] **Tree example generation**

- [ ] **TA Learner from tree examples** 
     - [ ] Update O_a wrt. trees - Based on the index! - Yunjeong WIP
     - [ ] Update O_p wrt. trees - _Logic changed from earlier version!_ - Yunjeong WIP
     - [ ] Learn TA wrt. O_p and O_a - double check with Gokul on learning TA wrt. O_a

- [ ] **Intersection** - _To reuse as much as possible_ 
     - Update based on revised data structures

- [ ] **Converter from TA to CFG**

- [ ] **Formatter for CFG** - _To reuse as much as possible, may have to modify_

### Testing 

(6 existing + 2-3 Real Grammars)

- [ ] Grammar 0 (Running paper example)
- [ ] Grammar 1 (Compiler - Boolean language)
- [ ] Grammar 2 (Compiler)
- [ ] Grammar 3 (Compiler)
- [ ] Grammar 4 (StackOverflow)
- [ ] Grammar 5 (StackOVerflow)
- [ ] Grammar 6 (Michelson)
- [ ] Grammar 7 (KaiTai)
- [ ] Grammar 8 (Scilla? - likely to be nonaddressable or SQL)


### Room for improvement

* Logic for identifying nonaddreaable ambiguities in tree example
  generation is not exhaustive
