** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 7.
** Tokens involved: STAR PLUS
** The following explanations concentrate on token STAR.
** This state is reached from toplevel after reading:

expr2 PLUS expr2

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

toplevel 
expr EOF 
(?)

** In state 7, looking ahead at STAR, reducing production..
** expr -> expr2 PLUS expr2
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

expr2 PLUS expr2 
expr2 STAR expr2 // lookahead token appears
expr // lookahead token is inherited
expr2 PLUS expr2 . 

** In state 7, looking ahead at STAR, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

expr2 PLUS expr2 
           expr2 . STAR expr2 

** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 5.
** Tokens involved: STAR PLUS
