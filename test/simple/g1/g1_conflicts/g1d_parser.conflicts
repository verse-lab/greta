** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 5.
** Token involved: STAR
** This state is reached from toplevel after reading:

expr2 STAR expr2

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

toplevel 
expr EOF 
expr2 PLUS expr2 
(?)

** In state 5, looking ahead at STAR, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

expr2 STAR expr2 
           expr2 . STAR expr2 

** In state 5, looking ahead at STAR, reducing production..
** expr2 -> expr2 STAR expr2
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

expr2 STAR expr2 // lookahead token appears
expr2 STAR expr2 .
