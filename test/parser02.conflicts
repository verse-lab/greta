** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 8.
** Token involved: ELSE
** This state is reached from program after reading:

IF cond_expr THEN IF cond_expr THEN expr3

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

program 
expr1 EOF 
expr2 
expr3 
(?)

** In state 8, looking ahead at ELSE, reducing production
** expr3 -> IF cond_expr THEN expr3
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond_expr THEN expr3 ELSE expr3 // lookahead token appears
                  IF cond_expr THEN expr3 . 

** In state 8, looking ahead at ELSE, shifting is permitted
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond_expr THEN expr3 
                  IF cond_expr THEN expr3 . ELSE expr3
