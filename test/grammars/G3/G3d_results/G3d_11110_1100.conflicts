** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 14.
** Token involved: PLUS
** This state is reached from prog after reading:

x2 PLUS x2

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

prog 
e1 EOF 
x1 LPAREN COMMA x1 RPAREN SEMI 
x2 
(?)

** In state 14, looking ahead at PLUS, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x2 PLUS x2 
        x2 . PLUS x2 

** In state 14, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** x2 -> x2 PLUS x2
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x2 PLUS x2 // lookahead token appears
x2 PLUS x2 .
