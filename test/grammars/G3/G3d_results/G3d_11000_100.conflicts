** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 16.
** Token involved: DASH
** This state is reached from prog after reading:

x2 PLUS x1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

prog 
e1 EOF 
x1 LPAREN COMMA x1 RPAREN SEMI 
(?)

** In state 16, looking ahead at DASH, reducing production..
** x1 -> x2 PLUS x1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 DASH x1 // lookahead token appears
x2 PLUS x1 . 

** In state 16, looking ahead at DASH, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x2 PLUS x1 
        x1 . DASH x1
