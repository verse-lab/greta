** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 21.
** Token involved: PLUS
** This state is reached from prog after reading:

x1 DASH x1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

prog 
e1 EOF 
x1 LPAREN COMMA x1 RPAREN SEMI 
(?)

** In state 21, looking ahead at PLUS, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 DASH x1 
        x1 . PLUS x1 

** In state 21, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** x1 -> x1 DASH x1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 PLUS x1 // lookahead token appears
x1 DASH x1 . 

** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 19.
** Tokens involved: PLUS DASH
** The following explanations concentrate on token PLUS.
** This state is reached from prog after reading:
