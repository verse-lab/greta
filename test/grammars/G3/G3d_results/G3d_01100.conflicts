** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 22.
** Token involved: PLUS
** This state is reached from prog after reading:

LPAREN x1 PLUS x1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

prog 
x2 EOF 
x4 LPAREN COMMA x4 RPAREN SEMI 
x5 
LPAREN x1 RPAREN 
       (?)

** In state 22, looking ahead at PLUS, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 PLUS x1 
        x1 . PLUS x1 

** In state 22, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** x1 -> x1 PLUS x1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 PLUS x1 // lookahead token appears
x1 PLUS x1 .
