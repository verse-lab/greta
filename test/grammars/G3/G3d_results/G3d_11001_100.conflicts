** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 15.
** Token involved: DASH
** This state is reached from prog after reading:

x3 PLUS x2

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

prog 
e1 EOF 
x2 LPAREN COMMA x2 RPAREN SEMI 
(?)

** In state 15, looking ahead at DASH, reducing production..
** x2 -> x3 PLUS x2
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x2 DASH x2 // lookahead token appears
x3 PLUS x2 . 

** In state 15, looking ahead at DASH, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x3 PLUS x2 
        x2 . DASH x2
