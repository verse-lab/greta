** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 18.
** Token involved: PLUS
** This state is reached from prog after reading:

** In state 18, looking ahead at PLUS, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x3 DASH x3 
        x3 . PLUS x3 

** In state 18, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** x3 -> x3 DASH x3
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x3 PLUS x3 // lookahead token appears
x3 DASH x3 . 

** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 16.
