** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 19.
** Token involved: PLUS
** This state is reached from prog after reading:

x3 DASH x3

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

prog 
x2 EOF 
x3 LPAREN COMMA x3 RPAREN SEMI 
(?)

** In state 19, looking ahead at PLUS, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x3 DASH x3 
        x3 . PLUS x3 

** In state 19, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** x3 -> x3 DASH x3
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x3 PLUS x3 // lookahead token appears
x3 DASH x3 . 

** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 17.
** Tokens involved: PLUS DASH
** The following explanations concentrate on token PLUS.
** This state is reached from prog after reading:
