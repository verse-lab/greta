** In state 13, looking ahead at DASH, reducing production..
** x3 -> x3 PLUS x3
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x3 DASH x4 // lookahead token appears
x3 PLUS x3 . 

** In state 13, looking ahead at DASH, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x3 PLUS x3
