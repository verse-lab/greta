** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 16.
** Tokens involved: STAR EQEQ DASH
** The following explanations concentrate on token STAR.
** This state is reached from prog after reading:

exp1 PLUS exp1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

prog 
e1 EOF 
exp1 LPAREN COMMA exp1 RPAREN SEMI 
(?)

** In state 16, looking ahead at STAR, reducing production..
** exp1 -> exp1 PLUS exp1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

exp1 STAR exp2 // lookahead token appears
exp1 PLUS exp1 . 

** In state 16, looking ahead at STAR, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

exp1 PLUS exp1 
          exp1 . STAR exp2
