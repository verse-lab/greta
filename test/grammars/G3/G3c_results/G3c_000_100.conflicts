** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 23.
** Token involved: STAR
** This state is reached from prog after reading:

x1 DASH x1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

prog 
e1 EOF 
x1 LPAREN COMMA x1 RPAREN SEMI 
(?)

** In state 23, looking ahead at STAR, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 DASH x1 
        x1 . STAR x5 

** In state 23, looking ahead at STAR, reducing production..
** x1 -> x1 DASH x1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 STAR x5 // lookahead token appears
x1 DASH x1 .
