** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 20.
** Token involved: EQEQ
** This state is reached from prog after reading:

x2 DASH x2

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

prog 
e1 EOF 
x5 EQ x1 SEMI 
x2 LBRACKET x2 RBRACKET 
(?)

** In state 20, looking ahead at EQEQ, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x2 DASH x2 
        x2 . EQEQ x4 

** In state 20, looking ahead at EQEQ, reducing production..
** x2 -> x2 DASH x2
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x2 EQEQ x4 // lookahead token appears
x2 DASH x2 .
