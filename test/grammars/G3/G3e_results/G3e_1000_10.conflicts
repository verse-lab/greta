** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 18.
** Token involved: EQEQ
** This state is reached from prog after reading:

x3 DASH x3

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

prog 
e1 EOF 
x6 EQ x2 SEMI 
x3 LBRACKET x3 RBRACKET 
(?)

** In state 18, looking ahead at EQEQ, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x3 DASH x3 
        x3 . EQEQ x5 

** In state 18, looking ahead at EQEQ, reducing production..
** x3 -> x3 DASH x3
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x3 EQEQ x5 // lookahead token appears
x3 DASH x3 .
