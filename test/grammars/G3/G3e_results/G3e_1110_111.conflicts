** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 17.
** Token involved: EQEQ
** This state is reached from prog after reading:

x4 DASH x4

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

prog 
e1 EOF 
x7 EQ x1 SEMI 
x4 LBRACKET x4 RBRACKET 
(?)

** In state 17, looking ahead at EQEQ, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x4 DASH x4 
        x4 . EQEQ x6 

** In state 17, looking ahead at EQEQ, reducing production..
** x4 -> x4 DASH x4
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x4 EQEQ x6 // lookahead token appears
x4 DASH x4 .
