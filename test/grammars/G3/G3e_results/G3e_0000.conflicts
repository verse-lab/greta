** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 15.
** Tokens involved: PLUS DASH
** The following explanations concentrate on token PLUS.
** This state is reached from prog after reading:

x2 STAR x1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

prog 
e1 EOF 
x1 LPAREN COMMA x1 RPAREN SEMI 
(?)

** In state 15, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** x1 -> x2 STAR x1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 PLUS x1 // lookahead token appears
x2 STAR x1 . 

** In state 15, looking ahead at PLUS, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x2 STAR x1 
        x1 . PLUS x1 

** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 10.
** Token involved: EQEQ
** This state is reached from prog after reading:

DASH x2

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

prog 
e1 EOF 
x4 EQ x1 SEMI 
x2 LBRACKET x2 RBRACKET 
(?)

** In state 10, looking ahead at EQEQ, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

DASH x2 
     x2 . EQEQ x3 

** In state 10, looking ahead at EQEQ, reducing production..
** x2 -> DASH x2
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x2 EQEQ x3 // lookahead token appears
DASH x2 .
