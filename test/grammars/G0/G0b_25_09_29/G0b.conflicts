** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 17.
** Tokens involved: PLUS MUL
** The following explanations concentrate on token PLUS.
** This state is reached from program after reading:

expr1 MUL expr1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

program 
expr1 EOF 
(?)

** In state 17, looking ahead at PLUS, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

expr1 MUL expr1 
          expr1 . PLUS expr1 

** In state 17, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** expr1 -> expr1 MUL expr1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

expr1 PLUS expr1 // lookahead token appears
expr1 MUL expr1 .

** Tokens involved: PLUS MUL
** The following explanations concentrate on token PLUS.
