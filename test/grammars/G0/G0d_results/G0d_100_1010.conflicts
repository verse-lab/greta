** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 9.
** Tokens involved: PLUS MUL ELSE
** The following explanations concentrate on token MUL.
** This state is reached from program after reading:

IF cond_expr THEN x3

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

program 
e1 EOF 
(?)

** In state 9, looking ahead at MUL, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond_expr THEN e1 ELSE e1 
                  x2 
                  x3 . MUL x2 

** In state 9, looking ahead at MUL, reducing production..
** x3 -> IF cond_expr THEN x3
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x2 
x3 MUL x2 // lookahead token appears
IF cond_expr THEN x3 .
