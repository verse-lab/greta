** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 20.
** Token involved: PLUS
** This state is reached from program after reading:

IF cond_expr THEN x1 ELSE x1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

program

** In state 20, looking ahead at PLUS, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond_expr THEN x1 ELSE x1 
                          x1 . PLUS x3 

** In state 20, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** x1 -> IF cond_expr THEN x1 ELSE x1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 PLUS x3 // lookahead token appears
IF cond_expr THEN x1 ELSE x1 . 

** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 11.
** Token involved: MUL
** This state is reached from program after reading:
