** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 8.
** Tokens involved: PLUS ELSE
** The following explanations concentrate on token PLUS.
** This state is reached from program after reading:

IF cond THEN x2

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

program 
e1 EOF 
x1 MUL e1 
(?)

** In state 8, looking ahead at PLUS, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond THEN x1 ELSE x1 
             x2 . PLUS x1 

** In state 8, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** x2 -> IF cond THEN x2
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x2 PLUS x1 // lookahead token appears
IF cond THEN x2 .
