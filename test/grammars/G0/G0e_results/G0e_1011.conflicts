** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 19.
** Token involved: PLUS
** This state is reached from program after reading:

IF cond THEN x1 ELSE x1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

program 
e1 EOF

(?)

** In state 19, looking ahead at PLUS, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond THEN x1 ELSE x1 
                     x1 . PLUS x2 

** In state 19, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** x1 -> IF cond THEN x1 ELSE x1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 PLUS x2 // lookahead token appears
IF cond THEN x1 ELSE x1 . 

** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 10.
** Token involved: MUL
** This state is reached from program after reading:

x2 MUL x2

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

** In state 10, looking ahead at MUL, shifting is permitted..

** In state 10, looking ahead at MUL, reducing production..
** x2 -> x2 MUL x2
