** Token involved: PLUS
** This state is reached from program after reading:

** In state 20, looking ahead at PLUS, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond THEN e1 ELSE e1 
                     e1 . PLUS x1 

** In state 20, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** e1 -> IF cond THEN e1 ELSE e1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

e1 PLUS x1 // lookahead token appears
IF cond THEN e1 ELSE e1 . 

** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 14.
** Token involved: MUL
** This state is reached from program after reading:
