** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 18.
** Token involved: MUL
** This state is reached from program after reading:

x2 MUL x2

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

program 
e1 EOF 
x1 
x2 PLUS x1 
(?)

** In state 18, looking ahead at MUL, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x2 MUL x2 
       x2 . MUL x2 

** In state 18, looking ahead at MUL, reducing production..
** x2 -> x2 MUL x2
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x2 MUL x2 // lookahead token appears
x2 MUL x2 .
