** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 15.
** Tokens involved: PLUS MUL
** The following explanations concentrate on token PLUS.
** This state is reached from program after reading:

IF cond_expr THEN expr1 ELSE expr1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

program

** In state 15, looking ahead at PLUS, shifting is permitted
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond_expr THEN expr1 ELSE expr1 
                             expr1 . PLUS expr2 

** In state 15, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production
** expr1 -> IF cond_expr THEN expr1 ELSE expr1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

expr1 PLUS expr2 // lookahead token appears
IF cond_expr THEN expr1 ELSE expr1 .
