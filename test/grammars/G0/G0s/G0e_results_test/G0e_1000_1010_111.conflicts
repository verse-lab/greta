** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 16.
** Token involved: MUL
** This state is reached from program after reading:

x2 PLUS e1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

program

** In state 16, looking ahead at MUL, reducing production..
** e1 -> x2 PLUS e1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

e1 MUL x2 // lookahead token appears
x2 PLUS e1 . 

** In state 16, looking ahead at MUL, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x2 PLUS e1 
        e1 . MUL x2 

** Conflict (reduce/reduce) in state 8.
