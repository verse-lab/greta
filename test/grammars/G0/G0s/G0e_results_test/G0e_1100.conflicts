** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 20.
** Tokens involved: PLUS MUL
** The following explanations concentrate on token PLUS.
** This state is reached from program after reading:

IF cond THEN e1 ELSE e1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

** In state 20, looking ahead at PLUS, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond THEN e1 ELSE e1

** In state 20, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** e1 -> IF cond THEN e1 ELSE e1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

e1 PLUS x1 // lookahead token appears
IF cond THEN e1 ELSE e1 .
