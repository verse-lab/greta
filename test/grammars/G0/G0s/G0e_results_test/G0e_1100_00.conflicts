** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 21.
** Token involved: MUL
** This state is reached from program after reading:

IF cond THEN e1 ELSE e1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

program 
e1 EOF 
(?)

** In state 21, looking ahead at MUL, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond THEN e1 ELSE e1 
                     e1 . MUL e1 

** In state 21, looking ahead at MUL, reducing production..
** e1 -> IF cond THEN e1 ELSE e1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

e1 MUL e1 // lookahead token appears
IF cond THEN e1 ELSE e1 . 

** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 19.
** Token involved: MUL
** This state is reached from program after reading:

e1 MUL e1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

** In state 19, looking ahead at MUL, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

e1 MUL e1 
       e1 . MUL e1 

** In state 19, looking ahead at MUL, reducing production..
** e1 -> e1 MUL e1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

e1 MUL e1 // lookahead token appears
e1 MUL e1 . 

** Conflict (reduce/reduce) in state 8.
** Tokens involved: PLUS MUL ELSE
** The following explanations concentrate on token PLUS.
** This state is reached from program after reading:

IF cond THEN x2

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

program

** In state 8, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** x1 -> x2
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond THEN e1 ELSE e1 
             x1 
             x1 PLUS x2 // lookahead token appears
             x2 . 

** In state 8, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** x2 -> IF cond THEN x2
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 
x1 PLUS x2 // lookahead token appears
x2 // lookahead token is inherited
IF cond THEN x2 .
