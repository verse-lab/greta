** Conflict (reduce/reduce) in state 9.
** Tokens involved: PLUS MUL ELSE
** The following explanations concentrate on token PLUS.
** This state is reached from program after reading:

IF cond THEN x3

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

e1 EOF 
(?)

** In state 9, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** x2 -> x3
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond THEN e1 ELSE e1 
             x1 
             x1 PLUS x2 // lookahead token appears
             x2 // lookahead token is inherited
             x3 . 

** In state 9, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** x3 -> IF cond THEN x3
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 
x1 PLUS x2 // lookahead token appears
x2 // lookahead token is inherited
x3 // lookahead token is inherited
IF cond THEN x3 .
