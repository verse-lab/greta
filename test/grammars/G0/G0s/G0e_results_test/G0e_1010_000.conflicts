** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 15.
** Tokens involved: PLUS ELSE
** The following explanations concentrate on token PLUS.
** This state is reached from program after reading:

IF cond THEN x1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

program 
e1 EOF 
(?)

** In state 15, looking ahead at PLUS, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond THEN e1 ELSE e1 
             x1 . PLUS e1 

** In state 15, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** x1 -> IF cond THEN x1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 PLUS e1 // lookahead token appears
IF cond THEN x1 .
