** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 13.
** Token involved: ELSE
** This state is reached from program after reading:

IF cond THEN IF cond THEN e1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

program 
e1 EOF

** In state 13, looking ahead at ELSE, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond THEN e1 ELSE e1 
             IF cond THEN e1 . ELSE e1 

** In state 13, looking ahead at ELSE, reducing production..
** e1 -> IF cond THEN e1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond THEN e1 ELSE e1 // lookahead token appears
             IF cond THEN e1 . 

** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 12.
** Token involved: MUL
** This state is reached from program after reading:

x1 MUL x1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

program 
e1 EOF

** In state 12, looking ahead at MUL, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 MUL x1

** In state 12, looking ahead at MUL, reducing production..
** x1 -> x1 MUL x1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:
