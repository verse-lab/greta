** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 16.
** Token involved: MUL
** This state is reached from program after reading:

x1 MUL x1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

program 
e1 EOF 
x1

** In state 16, looking ahead at MUL, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 MUL x1 
       x1 . MUL x1 

** In state 16, looking ahead at MUL, reducing production..
** x1 -> x1 MUL x1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 MUL x1 // lookahead token appears
x1 MUL x1 . 

** Conflict (reduce/reduce) in state 8.
** Token involved: ELSE
** This state is reached from program after reading:
