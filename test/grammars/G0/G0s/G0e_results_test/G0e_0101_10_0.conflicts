** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 24.
** Token involved: MUL
** This state is reached from program after reading:

e1 MUL e1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

program 
e1 EOF 
(?)

** In state 24, looking ahead at MUL, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

e1 MUL e1 
       e1 . MUL e1 

** In state 24, looking ahead at MUL, reducing production..
** e1 -> e1 MUL e1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

e1 MUL e1 // lookahead token appears
e1 MUL e1 .
