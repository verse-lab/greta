** Conflict (reduce/reduce) in state 12.
** Token involved: ELSE
** This state is reached from program after reading:

IF cond THEN IF cond THEN x2

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

program 
e1 EOF 
x1 MUL e1 
(?)

** In state 12, looking ahead at ELSE, reducing production..
** x1 -> x2
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond THEN x1 ELSE x1 
             IF cond THEN x1 ELSE x1 // lookahead token appears
                          x2 . 

** In state 12, looking ahead at ELSE, reducing production..
** x2 -> IF cond THEN x2
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond THEN x1 ELSE x1 // lookahead token appears
             x2 // lookahead token is inherited
             IF cond THEN x2 .
