** Conflict (reduce/reduce) in state 15.
** Token involved: ELSE
** This state is reached from program after reading:

IF cond_expr THEN IF cond_expr THEN x1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

** In state 15, looking ahead at ELSE, reducing production..
** e1 -> x1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond_expr THEN e1 ELSE e1 
                  IF cond_expr THEN e1 ELSE e1 // lookahead token appears
                                    x1 . 

** In state 15, looking ahead at ELSE, reducing production..
** x1 -> IF cond_expr THEN x1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond_expr THEN e1 ELSE e1 // lookahead token appears
                  x1 // lookahead token is inherited
                  IF cond_expr THEN x1 .
