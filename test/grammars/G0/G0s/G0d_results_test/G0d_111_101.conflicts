** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 9.
** Token involved: ELSE
** This state is reached from program after reading:

IF cond_expr THEN IF cond_expr THEN x2

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

program 
e1 EOF 
x1 
x2 MUL x1 
(?)

** In state 9, looking ahead at ELSE, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond_expr THEN x2 ELSE x2 
                  IF cond_expr THEN x2 . ELSE x2 

** In state 9, looking ahead at ELSE, reducing production..
** x2 -> IF cond_expr THEN x2
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond_expr THEN x2 ELSE x2 // lookahead token appears
                  IF cond_expr THEN x2 .
