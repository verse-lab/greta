** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 15.
** Token involved: MUL
** This state is reached from program after reading:

IF cond_expr THEN x1 ELSE x1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

program

** In state 15, looking ahead at MUL, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond_expr THEN x1 ELSE x1 
                          x1 . MUL x1 

** In state 15, looking ahead at MUL, reducing production..
** x1 -> IF cond_expr THEN x1 ELSE x1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 MUL x1 // lookahead token appears
IF cond_expr THEN x1 ELSE x1 . 

** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 13.
** Token involved: MUL
** This state is reached from program after reading:

** Conflict (reduce/reduce) in state 9.
** Tokens involved: MUL ELSE
** The following explanations concentrate on token MUL.
** This state is reached from program after reading:

** In state 9, looking ahead at MUL, reducing production..
** x2 -> IF cond_expr THEN x2
