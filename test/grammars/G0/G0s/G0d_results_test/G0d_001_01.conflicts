** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 20.
** Token involved: PLUS
** This state is reached from program after reading:

IF cond_expr THEN e1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

program

** In state 20, looking ahead at PLUS, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond_expr THEN e1 
                  e1 . PLUS x3 

** In state 20, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** e1 -> IF cond_expr THEN e1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

e1 PLUS x3 // lookahead token appears
IF cond_expr THEN e1 . 

** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 19.
** Token involved: MUL
** This state is reached from program after reading:

x1 MUL x1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
