** Conflict (reduce/reduce) in state 9.
** Tokens involved: PLUS MUL ELSE
** The following explanations concentrate on token PLUS.
** This state is reached from program after reading:

IF cond_expr THEN x3

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

e1 EOF 
(?)

** In state 9, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** x2 -> x3
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond_expr THEN e1 ELSE e1 
                  x1 
                  x2 MUL x1 
                  x2 PLUS x4 // lookahead token appears
                  x3 . 

** In state 9, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** x3 -> IF cond_expr THEN x3
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 
x2 MUL x1 
x2 PLUS x4 // lookahead token appears
x3 // lookahead token is inherited
IF cond_expr THEN x3 .
