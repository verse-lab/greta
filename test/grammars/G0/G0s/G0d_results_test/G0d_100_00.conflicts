** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 18.
** Token involved: MUL
** This state is reached from program after reading:

IF cond_expr THEN e1 ELSE e1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

** In state 18, looking ahead at MUL, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond_expr THEN e1 ELSE e1 
                          e1 . MUL e1 

** In state 18, looking ahead at MUL, reducing production..
** e1 -> IF cond_expr THEN e1 ELSE e1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

e1 MUL e1 // lookahead token appears
IF cond_expr THEN e1 ELSE e1 . 

** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 16.
** Token involved: MUL
** This state is reached from program after reading:

** Conflict (reduce/reduce) in state 9.
** Tokens involved: PLUS MUL ELSE
** The following explanations concentrate on token PLUS.
** This state is reached from program after reading:
