** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 19.
** Token involved: MUL
** This state is reached from program after reading:

IF cond_expr THEN e1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

program 
e1 EOF 
(?)

** In state 19, looking ahead at MUL, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond_expr THEN e1 
                  e1 . MUL x1 

** In state 19, looking ahead at MUL, reducing production..
** e1 -> IF cond_expr THEN e1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

e1 MUL x1 // lookahead token appears
IF cond_expr THEN e1 .
