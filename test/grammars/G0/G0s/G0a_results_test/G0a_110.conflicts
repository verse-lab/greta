** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 18.
** Token involved: MUL
** This state is reached from program after reading:

IF cond_expr THEN x1 ELSE x1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

program 
e1 EOF 
x1 
(?)

** In state 18, looking ahead at MUL, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond_expr THEN x1 ELSE x1 
                          x1 . MUL x2 

** In state 18, looking ahead at MUL, reducing production..
** x1 -> IF cond_expr THEN x1 ELSE x1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 MUL x2 // lookahead token appears
IF cond_expr THEN x1 ELSE x1 . 

** Conflict (reduce/reduce) in state 8.
** Tokens involved: MUL ELSE
** The following explanations concentrate on token MUL.
** This state is reached from program after reading:

IF cond_expr THEN x2

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

program

** In state 8, looking ahead at MUL, reducing production..
** x1 -> x2
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond_expr THEN x1 ELSE x1 
                  x1 MUL x2 // lookahead token appears
                  x2 . 

** In state 8, looking ahead at MUL, reducing production..
** x2 -> IF cond_expr THEN x2
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 MUL x2 // lookahead token appears
x2 // lookahead token is inherited
IF cond_expr THEN x2 .
