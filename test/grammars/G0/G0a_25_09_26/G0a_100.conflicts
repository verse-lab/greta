** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 14.
** Tokens involved: MUL ELSE
** The following explanations concentrate on token MUL.
** This state is reached from program after reading:

IF cond_expr THEN x4

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

program 
e1 EOF 
x2 
(?)

** In state 14, looking ahead at MUL, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond_expr THEN x2 ELSE x2 
                  x3 
                  x4 . MUL x3 

** In state 14, looking ahead at MUL, reducing production..
** x4 -> IF cond_expr THEN x4
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x3 
x4 MUL x3 // lookahead token appears
IF cond_expr THEN x4 .
