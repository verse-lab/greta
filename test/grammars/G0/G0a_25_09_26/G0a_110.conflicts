** Conflict (reduce/reduce) in state 14.
** Tokens involved: MUL ELSE
** The following explanations concentrate on token MUL.
** This state is reached from program after reading:

IF cond_expr THEN x4

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

** In state 14, looking ahead at MUL, reducing production..
** x3 -> x4
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond_expr THEN x2 ELSE x2 
                  x3 
                  x3 MUL x4 // lookahead token appears
                  x4 . 

** In state 14, looking ahead at MUL, reducing production..
** x4 -> IF cond_expr THEN x4
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x3 
x3 MUL x4 // lookahead token appears
x4 // lookahead token is inherited
IF cond_expr THEN x4 .
