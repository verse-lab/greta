** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 39.
** Tokens involved: OR IFF AND
** The following explanations concentrate on token OR.
** This state is reached from constr after reading:

NOT bool_expr

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

constr 
bool_expr EOF 
(?)

** In state 39, looking ahead at OR, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

NOT bool_expr 
    bool_expr . OR bool_expr 

** In state 39, looking ahead at OR, reducing production..
** bool_expr -> NOT bool_expr
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

bool_expr OR bool_expr // lookahead token appears
NOT bool_expr .
