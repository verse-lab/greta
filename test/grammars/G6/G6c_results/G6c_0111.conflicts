** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 38.
** Token involved: IFF
** This state is reached from constr after reading:

e1 IFF e1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

constr 
e1 EOF 
(?)

** In state 38, looking ahead at IFF, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

e1 IFF e1 
       e1 . IFF e1 

** In state 38, looking ahead at IFF, reducing production..
** e1 -> e1 IFF e1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

e1 IFF e1 // lookahead token appears
e1 IFF e1 .
