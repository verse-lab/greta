** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 33.
** Token involved: IFF
** This state is reached from constr after reading:

x1 IFF x1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

constr 
e1 EOF 
x1 
(?)

** In state 33, looking ahead at IFF, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 IFF x1 
       x1 . IFF x1 

** In state 33, looking ahead at IFF, reducing production..
** x1 -> x1 IFF x1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 IFF x1 // lookahead token appears
x1 IFF x1 .
