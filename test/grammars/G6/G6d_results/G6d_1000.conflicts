** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 39.
** Tokens involved: OR AND
** The following explanations concentrate on token OR.
** This state is reached from constr after reading:

NOT e1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

constr 
e1 EOF 
(?)

** In state 39, looking ahead at OR, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

NOT e1 
    e1 . OR e1 

** In state 39, looking ahead at OR, reducing production..
** e1 -> NOT e1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

e1 OR e1 // lookahead token appears
NOT e1 . 

** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 32.
** Token involved: IFF
** This state is reached from constr after reading:

x1 IFF x1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

constr 
e1 EOF 
x1 
(?)

** In state 32, looking ahead at IFF, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 IFF x1 
       x1 . IFF x1 

** In state 32, looking ahead at IFF, reducing production..
** x1 -> x1 IFF x1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:
