** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 42.
** Token involved: AND
** This state is reached from constr after reading:

NOT x1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

constr 
e1 EOF 
x1 
(?)

** In state 42, looking ahead at AND, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

NOT x1 
    x1 . AND x1 

** In state 42, looking ahead at AND, reducing production..
** x1 -> NOT x1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 AND x1 // lookahead token appears
NOT x1 .
