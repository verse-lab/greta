** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 42.
** Token involved: AND
** This state is reached from constr after reading:

NOT x2

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

constr 
e1 EOF 
x2 IFF e1 
(?)

** In state 42, looking ahead at AND, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

NOT x2 
    x2 . AND x2 

** In state 42, looking ahead at AND, reducing production..
** x2 -> NOT x2
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x2 AND x2 // lookahead token appears
NOT x2 .
