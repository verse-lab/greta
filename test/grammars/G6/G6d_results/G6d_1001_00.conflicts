** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 43.
** Token involved: AND
** This state is reached from constr after reading:

NOT x3

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

** In state 43, looking ahead at AND, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

NOT x3 
    x3 . AND x3 

** In state 43, looking ahead at AND, reducing production..
** x3 -> NOT x3
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x3 AND x3 // lookahead token appears
NOT x3 .
