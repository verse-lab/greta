** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 11.
** Token involved: POWER
** This state is reached from constr after reading:

x4 POWER x4

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

constr 
e1 EOF 
x1

x3 NE x3 
x4 
(?)

** In state 11, looking ahead at POWER, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x4 POWER x4 
         x4 . POWER x4 

** In state 11, looking ahead at POWER, reducing production..
** x4 -> x4 POWER x4
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x4 POWER x4 // lookahead token appears
x4 POWER x4 .
