** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 23.
** Token involved: POWER
** This state is reached from constr after reading:

x2 DIVIDE x2

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

(?)

** In state 23, looking ahead at POWER, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x2 DIVIDE x2 
          x2 . POWER x3 

** In state 23, looking ahead at POWER, reducing production..
** x2 -> x2 DIVIDE x2
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x2 POWER x3 // lookahead token appears
x2 DIVIDE x2 .
