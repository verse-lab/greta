** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 41.
** Tokens involved: IFF AND
** The following explanations concentrate on token IFF.
** This state is reached from constr after reading:

NOT x1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

constr 
e1 EOF 
x1 
(?)

** In state 41, looking ahead at IFF, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

NOT x1 
    x1 . IFF x1 

** In state 41, looking ahead at IFF, reducing production..
** x1 -> NOT x1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 IFF x1 // lookahead token appears
NOT x1 . 

** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 7.
** Token involved: POWER
** This state is reached from constr after reading:

x3 POWER x3

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

constr 
e1 EOF 
x1 
x2 NE x2 
x3 
(?)

** In state 7, looking ahead at POWER, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x3 POWER x3 
         x3 . POWER x3 

** In state 7, looking ahead at POWER, reducing production..
** x3 -> x3 POWER x3
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x3 POWER x3 // lookahead token appears
x3 POWER x3 .
