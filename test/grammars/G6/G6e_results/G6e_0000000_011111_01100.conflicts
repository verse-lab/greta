** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 14.
** Tokens involved: MINUS DIVIDE
** The following explanations concentrate on token MINUS.
** This state is reached from constr after reading:

x5 POWER x4

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

** In state 14, looking ahead at MINUS, reducing production..
** x4 -> x5 POWER x4
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x4 MINUS x4 // lookahead token appears
x5 POWER x4 . 

** In state 14, looking ahead at MINUS, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x5 POWER x4 
         x4 . MINUS x4
