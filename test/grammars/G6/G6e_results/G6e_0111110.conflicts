** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 41.
** Tokens involved: IFF AND
** The following explanations concentrate on token IFF.
** This state is reached from constr after reading:

NOT x1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

constr 
e1 EOF 
x1 
(?)

** In state 41, looking ahead at IFF, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

NOT x1 
    x1 . IFF x1 

** In state 41, looking ahead at IFF, reducing production..
** x1 -> NOT x1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 IFF x1 // lookahead token appears
NOT x1 . 

** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 19.
** Token involved: POWER
** This state is reached from constr after reading:

x2 POWER x2

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

constr 
e1 EOF 
x1 
x2 NE x2 
(?)

** In state 19, looking ahead at POWER, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x2 POWER x2 
         x2 . POWER x2 

** In state 19, looking ahead at POWER, reducing production..
** x2 -> x2 POWER x2
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x2 POWER x2 // lookahead token appears
x2 POWER x2 .
