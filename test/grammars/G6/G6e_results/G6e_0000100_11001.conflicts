** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 20.
** Token involved: POWER
** This state is reached from constr after reading:

x3 DIVIDE x3

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

(?)

** In state 20, looking ahead at POWER, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x3 DIVIDE x3 
          x3 . POWER x4 

** In state 20, looking ahead at POWER, reducing production..
** x3 -> x3 DIVIDE x3
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x3 POWER x4 // lookahead token appears
x3 DIVIDE x3 .
