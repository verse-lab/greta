** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 19.
** Token involved: POWER
** This state is reached from constr after reading:

x2 DIVIDE x2

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

constr

** In state 19, looking ahead at POWER, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x2 DIVIDE x2 
          x2 . POWER x2 

** In state 19, looking ahead at POWER, reducing production..
** x2 -> x2 DIVIDE x2
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x2 POWER x2 // lookahead token appears
x2 DIVIDE x2 . 

** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 17.
** Tokens involved: POWER DIVIDE
** The following explanations concentrate on token POWER.
