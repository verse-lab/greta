** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 17.
** Token involved: POWER
** This state is reached from constr after reading:

x2 POWER x2

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

constr 
e1 EOF 
x1 
x2 NE x2 
(?)

** In state 17, looking ahead at POWER, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x2 POWER x2 
         x2 . POWER x2 

** In state 17, looking ahead at POWER, reducing production..
** x2 -> x2 POWER x2
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x2 POWER x2 // lookahead token appears
x2 POWER x2 .
