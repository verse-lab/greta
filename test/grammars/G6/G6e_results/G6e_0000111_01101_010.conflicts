** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 21.
** Token involved: POWER
** This state is reached from constr after reading:

x4 DIVIDE x4

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

(?)

** In state 21, looking ahead at POWER, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x4 DIVIDE x4 
          x4 . POWER x6 

** In state 21, looking ahead at POWER, reducing production..
** x4 -> x4 DIVIDE x4
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x4 POWER x6 // lookahead token appears
x4 DIVIDE x4 .
