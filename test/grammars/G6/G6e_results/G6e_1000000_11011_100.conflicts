** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 16.
** Token involved: DIVIDE
** This state is reached from constr after reading:

x3 POWER x2

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

constr

x2 NE x2 
(?)

** In state 16, looking ahead at DIVIDE, reducing production..
** x2 -> x3 POWER x2
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x2 DIVIDE x2 // lookahead token appears
x3 POWER x2 . 

** In state 16, looking ahead at DIVIDE, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x3 POWER x2 
         x2 . DIVIDE x2
