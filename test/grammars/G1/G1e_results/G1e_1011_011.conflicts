** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 8.
** Token involved: AMPER
** This state is reached from toplevel after reading:

x3 AMPER x3

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

toplevel 
e1 EOF 
x1

x3 
(?)

** In state 8, looking ahead at AMPER, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x3 AMPER x3 
         x3 . AMPER x3 

** In state 8, looking ahead at AMPER, reducing production..
** x3 -> x3 AMPER x3
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x3 AMPER x3 // lookahead token appears
x3 AMPER x3 .
