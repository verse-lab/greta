** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 15.
** Tokens involved: BAR AMPER
** The following explanations concentrate on token BAR.
** This state is reached from toplevel after reading:

e1 AMPER e1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

toplevel 
e1 EOF 
(?)

** In state 15, looking ahead at BAR, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

e1 AMPER e1 
         e1 . BAR x1 

** In state 15, looking ahead at BAR, reducing production..
** e1 -> e1 AMPER e1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

e1 BAR x1 // lookahead token appears
e1 AMPER e1 . 

** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 9.
** Token involved: ARR
** This state is reached from toplevel after reading:

x1 ARR x1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

toplevel 
e1 EOF

(?)

** In state 9, looking ahead at ARR, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 ARR x1 
       x1 . ARR x1 

** In state 9, looking ahead at ARR, reducing production..
** x1 -> x1 ARR x1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 ARR x1 // lookahead token appears
x1 ARR x1 .
