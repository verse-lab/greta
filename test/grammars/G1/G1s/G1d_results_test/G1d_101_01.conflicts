** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 11.
** Token involved: AMPER
** This state is reached from toplevel after reading:

x2 AMPER x2

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

toplevel 
e1 EOF 
x1 
x2 ARR x1 
(?)

** In state 11, looking ahead at AMPER, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x2 AMPER x2 
         x2 . AMPER x2 

** In state 11, looking ahead at AMPER, reducing production..
** x2 -> x2 AMPER x2
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x2 AMPER x2 // lookahead token appears
x2 AMPER x2 .
