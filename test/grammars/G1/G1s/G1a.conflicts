** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 8.
** Tokens involved: BAR ARR
** The following explanations concentrate on token BAR.
** This state is reached from toplevel after reading:

bexp2 AMPER bexp1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

toplevel 
bexp1 EOF 
(?)

** In state 8, looking ahead at BAR, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

bexp2 AMPER bexp1 
            bexp1 . BAR bexp2 

** In state 8, looking ahead at BAR, reducing production..
** bexp1 -> bexp2 AMPER bexp1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

bexp1 BAR bexp2 // lookahead token appears
bexp2 AMPER bexp1 .
