** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 13.
** Tokens involved: ARR AMPER
** The following explanations concentrate on token ARR.
** This state is reached from toplevel after reading:

x1 AMPER x1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

toplevel 
e1 EOF 
x1 BAR e1 
(?)

** In state 13, looking ahead at ARR, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 AMPER x1 
         x1 . ARR x2 

** In state 13, looking ahead at ARR, reducing production..
** x1 -> x1 AMPER x1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 ARR x2 // lookahead token appears
x1 AMPER x1 .
