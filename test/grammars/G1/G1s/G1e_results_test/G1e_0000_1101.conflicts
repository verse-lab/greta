** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 12.
** Token involved: AMPER
** This state is reached from toplevel after reading:

x2 BAR e1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

toplevel 
e1 EOF 
(?)

** In state 12, looking ahead at AMPER, reducing production..
** e1 -> x2 BAR e1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

e1 AMPER x1 // lookahead token appears
x2 BAR e1 . 

** In state 12, looking ahead at AMPER, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x2 BAR e1 
       e1 . AMPER x1
