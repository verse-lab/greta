** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 8.
** Token involved: ARR
** This state is reached from toplevel after reading:

x2 AMPER x1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

toplevel 
e1 EOF 
x1

** In state 8, looking ahead at ARR, reducing production..
** x1 -> x2 AMPER x1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x1 ARR x2 // lookahead token appears
x2 AMPER x1 . 

** In state 8, looking ahead at ARR, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x2 AMPER x1 
         x1 . ARR x2
