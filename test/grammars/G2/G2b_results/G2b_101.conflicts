** Conflict (reduce/reduce) in state 35.
** Token involved: ELSE
** This state is reached from toplevel after reading:

IF LPAREN x3 RPAREN IF LPAREN x3 RPAREN x2

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

** In state 35, looking ahead at ELSE, reducing production..
** x1 -> x2
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF LPAREN x3 RPAREN x1 ELSE x1 
                    IF LPAREN x3 RPAREN x1 ELSE x1 // lookahead token appears
                                        x2 . 

** In state 35, looking ahead at ELSE, reducing production..
** x2 -> IF LPAREN x3 RPAREN x2
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF LPAREN x3 RPAREN x1 ELSE x1 // lookahead token appears
                    x2 // lookahead token is inherited
                    IF LPAREN x3 RPAREN x2 .
