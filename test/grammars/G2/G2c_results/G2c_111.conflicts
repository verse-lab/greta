** Conflict (reduce/reduce) in state 36.
** Token involved: ELSE
** This state is reached from toplevel after reading:

IF LPAREN x4 RPAREN IF LPAREN x4 RPAREN x3

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

** In state 36, looking ahead at ELSE, reducing production..
** x1 -> x3
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF LPAREN x4 RPAREN x1 ELSE x1 
                    IF LPAREN x4 RPAREN x1 ELSE x1 // lookahead token appears
                                        x3 . 

** In state 36, looking ahead at ELSE, reducing production..
** x3 -> IF LPAREN x4 RPAREN x3
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF LPAREN x4 RPAREN x1 ELSE x1 // lookahead token appears
                    x3 // lookahead token is inherited
                    IF LPAREN x4 RPAREN x3 .
