** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 12.
** Token involved: DASH
** This state is reached from toplevel after reading:

RETURN x4 DASH x4

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

toplevel 
e1 EOF 
x1 e1 
x2 
RETURN x3 SEMI 
       x4 
       (?)

** In state 12, looking ahead at DASH, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x4 DASH x4 
        x4 . DASH x4 

** In state 12, looking ahead at DASH, reducing production..
** x4 -> x4 DASH x4
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x4 DASH x4 // lookahead token appears
x4 DASH x4 .
