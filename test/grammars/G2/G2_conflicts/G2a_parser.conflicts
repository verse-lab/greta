** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 30.
** Token involved: ELSE
** This state is reached from toplevel after reading:

IF LPAREN exp RPAREN IF LPAREN exp RPAREN stmt

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

toplevel 
stmts EOF 
stmt stmts 
(?)

** In state 30, looking ahead at ELSE, reducing production
** stmt -> IF LPAREN exp RPAREN stmt
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF LPAREN exp RPAREN stmt ELSE stmt // lookahead token appears
                     IF LPAREN exp RPAREN stmt . 

** In state 30, looking ahead at ELSE, shifting is permitted
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF LPAREN exp RPAREN stmt 
                     IF LPAREN exp RPAREN stmt . ELSE stmt
