** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 17.
** Tokens involved: PLUS DASH
** The following explanations concentrate on token PLUS.
** This state is reached from toplevel after reading:

RETURN x3 DASH x3

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

toplevel 
e1 EOF 
x1 e1 
x2 
RETURN x3 SEMI 
       (?)

** In state 17, looking ahead at PLUS, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

x3 DASH x3 
        x3 . PLUS x3 

** In state 17, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** x3 -> x3 DASH x3
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

x3 PLUS x3 // lookahead token appears
x3 DASH x3 .
