** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 12.
** Token involved: OR
** This state is reached from program after reading:

NOT e1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

program

** In state 12, looking ahead at OR, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

NOT e1 
    e1 . OR x1 

** In state 12, looking ahead at OR, reducing production..
** e1 -> NOT e1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

e1 OR x1 // lookahead token appears
NOT e1 . 

** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 7.
** Token involved: AND
** This state is reached from program after reading:
