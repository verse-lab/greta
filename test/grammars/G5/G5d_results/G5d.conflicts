** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 11.
** Tokens involved: OR AND
** The following explanations concentrate on token OR.
** This state is reached from program after reading:

lexpr AND lexpr

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

program

** In state 11, looking ahead at OR, reducing production..
** lexpr -> lexpr AND lexpr
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

lexpr OR lexpr // lookahead token appears
lexpr AND lexpr . 

** In state 11, looking ahead at OR, shifting is permitted..
