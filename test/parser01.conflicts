** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 12.
** Token involved: MUL
** This state is reached from program after reading:

IF cond_expr THEN expr2 ELSE expr2

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

program

** In state 12, looking ahead at MUL, shifting is permitted
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond_expr THEN expr2 ELSE expr2 
                             expr2 . MUL expr2 

** In state 12, looking ahead at MUL, reducing production
** expr2 -> IF cond_expr THEN expr2 ELSE expr2
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

expr2 MUL expr2 // lookahead token appears
IF cond_expr THEN expr2 ELSE expr2 . 

** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 10.
