** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 19.
** Token involved: THEN
** This state is reached from prog1 after reading:

IF expr3

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

stmt6 EOF 
(?)

** In state 19, looking ahead at THEN, reducing production..
** expr2 -> expr3
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

stmt8 
IF expr2 THEN stmt8 // lookahead token appears
   expr3 . 

** In state 19, looking ahead at THEN, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF expr3 . THEN stmt5 ELSE stmt5
