** Conflict (reduce/reduce) in state 20.
** Token involved: ELSE
** This state is reached from prog7 after reading:

IF expr1 THEN IF expr1 THEN stmt4

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:

** In state 20, looking ahead at ELSE, reducing production..
** stmt2 -> stmt4
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF expr1 THEN stmt2 ELSE stmt2 
              IF expr1 THEN stmt2 ELSE stmt2 // lookahead token appears
                            stmt4 . 

** In state 20, looking ahead at ELSE, reducing production..
** stmt4 -> IF expr1 THEN stmt4
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF expr1 THEN stmt2 ELSE stmt2 // lookahead token appears
              stmt4 // lookahead token is inherited
              IF expr1 THEN stmt4 .
