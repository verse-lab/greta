** Conflict (reduce/reduce) in state 19.
** Token involved: ELSE
** This state is reached from prog1 after reading:

IF expr1 THEN IF expr1 THEN stmt5

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

** In state 19, looking ahead at ELSE, reducing production..
** stmt3 -> stmt5
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF expr1 THEN stmt3 ELSE stmt3 
              IF expr1 THEN stmt3 ELSE stmt3 // lookahead token appears
                            stmt5 . 

** In state 19, looking ahead at ELSE, reducing production..
** stmt5 -> IF expr1 THEN stmt5
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF expr1 THEN stmt3 ELSE stmt3 // lookahead token appears
              stmt5 // lookahead token is inherited
              IF expr1 THEN stmt5 .
