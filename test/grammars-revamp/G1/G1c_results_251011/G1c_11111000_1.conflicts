** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 22.
** Tokens involved: PLUS MUL ELSE
** The following explanations concentrate on token PLUS.
** This state is reached from prog1 after reading:

IF cond4 THEN expr1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

prog1 
expr5 EOF 
(?)

** In state 22, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** expr1 -> IF cond4 THEN expr1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

expr3 
expr2 
expr1 PLUS expr2 // lookahead token appears
IF cond4 THEN expr1 . 

** In state 22, looking ahead at PLUS, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond4 THEN expr5 ELSE expr5 
              expr3 
              expr2 
              expr1 . PLUS expr2
