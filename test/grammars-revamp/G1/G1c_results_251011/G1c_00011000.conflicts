** Conflict (reduce/reduce) in state 8.
** Token involved: ELSE
** This state is reached from prog1 after reading:

IF cond5 THEN IF cond5 THEN expr4

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

prog1 
expr1 EOF 
expr2 
expr3 MUL expr2 
(?)

** In state 8, looking ahead at ELSE, reducing production..
** expr3 -> expr4
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond5 THEN expr3 ELSE expr3 
              IF cond5 THEN expr3 ELSE expr3 // lookahead token appears
                            expr4 . 

** In state 8, looking ahead at ELSE, reducing production..
** expr4 -> IF cond5 THEN expr4
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond5 THEN expr3 ELSE expr3 // lookahead token appears
              expr4 // lookahead token is inherited
              IF cond5 THEN expr4 .
