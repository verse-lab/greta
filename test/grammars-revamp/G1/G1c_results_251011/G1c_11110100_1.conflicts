** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 23.
** Tokens involved: MUL ELSE
** The following explanations concentrate on token MUL.
** This state is reached from prog1 after reading:

IF cond5 THEN expr3

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

prog1 
expr6 EOF 
(?)

** In state 23, looking ahead at MUL, reducing production..
** expr3 -> IF cond5 THEN expr3
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

expr4 
expr3 MUL expr4 // lookahead token appears
IF cond5 THEN expr3 . 

** In state 23, looking ahead at MUL, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond5 THEN expr6 ELSE expr6 
              expr4 
              expr3 . MUL expr4
