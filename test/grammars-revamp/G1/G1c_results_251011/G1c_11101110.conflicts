** Conflict (reduce/reduce) in state 15.
** Token involved: ELSE
** This state is reached from prog1 after reading:

IF cond6 THEN IF cond6 THEN expr2

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

** In state 15, looking ahead at ELSE, reducing production..
** expr1 -> expr2
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond6 THEN expr1 ELSE expr1 
              IF cond6 THEN expr1 ELSE expr1 // lookahead token appears
                            expr2 . 

** In state 15, looking ahead at ELSE, reducing production..
** expr2 -> IF cond6 THEN expr2
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond6 THEN expr1 ELSE expr1 // lookahead token appears
              expr2 // lookahead token is inherited
              IF cond6 THEN expr2 .
