** Conflict (reduce/reduce) in state 12.
** Token involved: ELSE
** This state is reached from prog1 after reading:

IF cond6 THEN IF cond6 THEN expr3

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

prog1 
expr1 EOF 
expr2

** In state 12, looking ahead at ELSE, reducing production..
** expr2 -> expr3
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond6 THEN expr2 ELSE expr2 
              IF cond6 THEN expr2 ELSE expr2 // lookahead token appears
                            expr3 . 

** In state 12, looking ahead at ELSE, reducing production..
** expr3 -> IF cond6 THEN expr3
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond6 THEN expr2 ELSE expr2 // lookahead token appears
              expr3 // lookahead token is inherited
              IF cond6 THEN expr3 .
