** Conflict (reduce/reduce) in state 8.
** Token involved: ELSE
** This state is reached from prog1 after reading:

IF cond6 THEN IF cond6 THEN expr5

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

prog1 
expr1 EOF 
expr2 
expr3 
(?)

** In state 8, looking ahead at ELSE, reducing production..
** expr3 -> expr5
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond6 THEN expr3 ELSE expr3 
              IF cond6 THEN expr3 ELSE expr3 // lookahead token appears
                            expr5 . 

** In state 8, looking ahead at ELSE, reducing production..
** expr5 -> IF cond6 THEN expr5
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond6 THEN expr3 ELSE expr3 // lookahead token appears
              expr5 // lookahead token is inherited
              IF cond6 THEN expr5 .
