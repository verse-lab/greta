** Conflict (reduce/reduce) in state 9.
** Tokens involved: PLUS ELSE
** The following explanations concentrate on token PLUS.
** This state is reached from prog1 after reading:

IF cond5 THEN expr4

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

prog1 
expr1 EOF 
expr2 
(?)

** In state 9, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** expr3 -> expr4
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond5 THEN expr2 ELSE expr2 
              expr3 
              expr3 PLUS expr6 // lookahead token appears
              expr4 . 

** In state 9, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** expr4 -> IF cond5 THEN expr4
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

expr3 
expr3 PLUS expr6 // lookahead token appears
expr4 // lookahead token is inherited
IF cond5 THEN expr4 .
