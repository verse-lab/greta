** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 9.
** Tokens involved: PLUS MUL ELSE
** The following explanations concentrate on token MUL.
** This state is reached from prog7 after reading:

IF cond6 THEN expr4

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

prog7 
expr1 EOF 
(?)

** In state 9, looking ahead at MUL, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond6 THEN expr1 ELSE expr1 
              expr2 
              expr3 
              expr4 . MUL expr3 

** In state 9, looking ahead at MUL, reducing production..
** expr4 -> IF cond6 THEN expr4
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

expr2 
expr3 
expr4 MUL expr3 // lookahead token appears
IF cond6 THEN expr4 .
