** Conflict (reduce/reduce) in state 9.
** Tokens involved: MUL ELSE
** The following explanations concentrate on token MUL.
** This state is reached from prog7 after reading:

IF cond6 THEN expr5

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

** In state 9, looking ahead at MUL, reducing production..
** expr3 -> expr5
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond6 THEN expr2 ELSE expr2 
              expr3 
              expr3 MUL expr5 // lookahead token appears
              expr5 . 

** In state 9, looking ahead at MUL, reducing production..
** expr5 -> IF cond6 THEN expr5
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

expr3 
expr3 MUL expr5 // lookahead token appears
expr5 // lookahead token is inherited
IF cond6 THEN expr5 .
