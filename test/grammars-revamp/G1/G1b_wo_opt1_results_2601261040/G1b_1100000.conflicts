** Conflict (reduce/reduce) in state 9.
** Tokens involved: PLUS MUL ELSE
** The following explanations concentrate on token PLUS.
** This state is reached from prog7 after reading:

IF cond6 THEN expr5

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

** In state 9, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** expr3 -> expr5
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond6 THEN expr1 ELSE expr1 
              expr2 
              expr2 PLUS expr4 // lookahead token appears
              expr3 // lookahead token is inherited
              expr5 . 

** In state 9, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** expr5 -> IF cond6 THEN expr5
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

expr2 
expr2 PLUS expr4 // lookahead token appears
expr3 // lookahead token is inherited
expr5 // lookahead token is inherited
IF cond6 THEN expr5 .
