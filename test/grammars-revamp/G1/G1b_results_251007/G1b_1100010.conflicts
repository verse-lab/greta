** Conflict (reduce/reduce) in state 13.
** Tokens involved: PLUS ELSE
** The following explanations concentrate on token PLUS.
** This state is reached from prog1 after reading:

IF cond5 THEN expr3

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

(?)

** In state 13, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** expr2 -> expr3
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond5 THEN expr1 ELSE expr1 
              expr2 
              expr2 PLUS expr6 // lookahead token appears
              expr3 . 

** In state 13, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** expr3 -> IF cond5 THEN expr3
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

expr2 
expr2 PLUS expr6 // lookahead token appears
expr3 // lookahead token is inherited
IF cond5 THEN expr3 .
