** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 19.
** Tokens involved: MUL ELSE
** The following explanations concentrate on token MUL.
** This state is reached from prog1 after reading:

IF cond3 THEN expr1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

prog1 
expr5 EOF 
expr4 
(?)

** In state 19, looking ahead at MUL, reducing production..
** expr1 -> IF cond3 THEN expr1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

expr2 
expr1 MUL expr2 // lookahead token appears
IF cond3 THEN expr1 . 

** In state 19, looking ahead at MUL, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond3 THEN expr4 ELSE expr4 
              expr2 
              expr1 . MUL expr2
