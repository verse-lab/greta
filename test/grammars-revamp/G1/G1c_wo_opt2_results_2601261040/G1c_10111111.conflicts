** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 6.
** Token involved: THEN
** This state is reached from prog1 after reading:

IF cond8

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

prog1 
expr2 EOF 
(?)

** In state 6, looking ahead at THEN, reducing production..
** cond6 -> cond8
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

expr3 
expr4 MUL expr3 
IF cond6 THEN expr4 ELSE expr4 // lookahead token appears
   cond8 . 

** In state 6, looking ahead at THEN, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond8 . THEN expr1
