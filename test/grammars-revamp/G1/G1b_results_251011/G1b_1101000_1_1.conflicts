** Conflict (reduce/reduce) in state 23.
** Tokens involved: PLUS MUL ELSE
** The following explanations concentrate on token PLUS.
** This state is reached from prog1 after reading:

IF cond4 THEN expr1

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

** In state 23, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** expr1 -> IF cond4 THEN expr1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

expr5 
expr5 PLUS expr3 // lookahead token appears
expr2 // lookahead token is inherited
expr1 // lookahead token is inherited
IF cond4 THEN expr1 . 

** In state 23, looking ahead at PLUS, reducing production..
** expr2 -> expr1
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF cond4 THEN expr6 ELSE expr6 
              expr5 
              expr5 PLUS expr3 // lookahead token appears
              expr2 // lookahead token is inherited
              expr1 .
