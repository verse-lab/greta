** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 34.
** Token involved: RPAREN
** This state is reached from topl1 after reading:

IF LPAREN ex3

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

topl1 
stmt13 EOF 
stmt6 stmt12 
(?)

** In state 34, looking ahead at RPAREN, reducing production..
** ex2 -> ex3
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

IF LPAREN ex2 RPAREN stmt5 // lookahead token appears
          ex3 . 

** In state 34, looking ahead at RPAREN, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

stmt8 
IF LPAREN ex3 . RPAREN stmt8 ELSE stmt8
