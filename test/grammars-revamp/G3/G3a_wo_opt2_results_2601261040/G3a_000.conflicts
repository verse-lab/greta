** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 37.
** Token involved: RPAREN
** This state is reached from topl1 after reading:

IF LPAREN ex11

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

topl1 
stmt14 EOF 
stmt2 stmt13 
(?)

** In state 37, looking ahead at RPAREN, reducing production..
** ex10 -> ex11
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

stmt5 
IF LPAREN ex10 RPAREN stmt5 ELSE stmt5 // lookahead token appears
          ex11 . 

** In state 37, looking ahead at RPAREN, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF LPAREN ex11 . RPAREN stmt1
