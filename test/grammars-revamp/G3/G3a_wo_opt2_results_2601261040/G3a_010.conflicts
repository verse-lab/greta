** Conflict (shift/reduce) in state 39.
** Token involved: RPAREN
** This state is reached from topl1 after reading:

IF LPAREN ex12

** The derivations that appear below have the following common factor:
** (The question mark symbol (?) represents the spot where the derivations begin to differ.)

topl1 
stmt15 EOF 
stmt2 stmt14 
(?)

** In state 39, looking ahead at RPAREN, reducing production..
** ex11 -> ex12
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:

stmt6 
IF LPAREN ex11 RPAREN stmt6 ELSE stmt6 // lookahead token appears
          ex12 . 

** In state 39, looking ahead at RPAREN, shifting is permitted..
** because of the following sub-derivation:

IF LPAREN ex12 . RPAREN stmt1
