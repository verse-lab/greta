** Conflict (reduce/reduce) in state 34.
** Token involved: ELSE
** This state is reached from topl1 after reading:

** In state 34, looking ahead at ELSE, reducing production..
** stmt1 -> stmt3

                     IF LPAREN ex6 RPAREN stmt1 ELSE stmt1 // lookahead token appears
                                          stmt3 . 

** In state 34, looking ahead at ELSE, reducing production..
** stmt3 -> IF LPAREN ex6 RPAREN stmt3
** is permitted because of the following sub-derivation:
